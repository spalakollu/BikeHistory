Citi Bike is a bike-sharing service in New York City that allows users to rent and ride bikes from a network of self-service docking stations located throughout the city. To use Citi Bike, users must first sign up for a membership, which can be purchased online or at a Citi Bike kiosk. Once they have a membership, users can check out a bike from any Citi Bike docking station using their membership card or the Citi Bike app on their smartphone. After they have finished their ride, users can return the bike to any Citi Bike docking station. Citi Bike offers a variety of membership options, including daily, weekly, and annual memberships, as well as options for tourists and students. Citi Bike also offers electric bikes, which can be rented in the same way as standard bikes.
