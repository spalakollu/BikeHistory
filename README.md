In this dataset, we will explore the new york city bike rider's trips. The information about the rider's trip is located here. For the capstone project, we will be taking information from May 2022 to November 2022. At the time of beginning this project, data for december 2022 is not available. The dataset contains information on 676k trip riders from the last 6 months.

Citi Bike is a bike-sharing service in New York City that allows users to rent and ride bikes from a network of self-service docking stations located throughout the city. To use Citi Bike, users must first sign up for a membership, which can be purchased online or at a Citi Bike kiosk. Once they have a membership, users can check out a bike from any Citi Bike docking station using their membership card or the Citi Bike app on their smartphone. After they have finished their ride, users can return the bike to any Citi Bike docking station. Citi Bike offers a variety of membership options, including daily, weekly, and annual memberships, as well as options for tourists and students. Citi Bike also offers electric bikes, which can be rented in the same way as standard bikes.

CRISP-DM - This is the project management method used in the process to determine the findings.The below diagram explains the overall crisp-dm process.
